Information about the metadata (e.g., latitude, longitude, feed ID, channel name) of the sensor monitoring stations used in this dataset can be found on the [ESDR data visualization page](https://environmentaldata.org/#time=1642345888.849,1642950688.849&cursor=1642730480.675&plotHeight=5.000&plotAreaHeight=40.000&showFilters=true&showSettings=true&showResults=true&center=40.445982705178,-79.96401491796037&zoom=12). ESDR means the [Environmental Sensor Data Repository](https://esdr.cmucreatelab.org/), a service for hosting environmental data. The feed ID and the channel name in the [code for gettting the sensor data](/py/prediction/getData.py) corresponds to the metadata on the visualization page.
