# smell-pittsburgh-dataset-v1

Smell Pittsburgh is a web-based application that crowdsources smell reports so we all can better track how odors from pollutants travel through the air across the Pittsburgh region. More information is on the [Smell Pittsburgh website](https://smellpgh.org).

This is the first version of the Smell Pittsburgh dataset from 10/31/2016 (month/day/year) to 9/30/2018, including the following zipcodes in the Pittsburgh region in Pennsylvania, USA:

- 15221, 15218, 15222, 15219, 15201, 15224, 15213, 15232, 15206, 15208, 15217, 15207, 15260, 15104

This dataset is used for the Smell Pittsburgh paper below:

Below are descriptions about what each column means in the file that contains smell reports (the "smell_raw.csv"):
- EpochTime: the Epoch timestamp when the smell is experienced
- smell_value: the self-reported rating of the smell (described on the [Smell Pittsburgh website](https://smellpgh.org/how_it_works)) 
- smell_description: the self-reported description of the smell (e.g., woodsmoke)
- feelings_symptoms: the self-reported symptoms that may caused by the source of the smell (e.g., eye irritation)
- zipcode: the zipcode of the location where the smell is experienced

Information about the metadata (e.g., latitude, longitude, feed ID, channel name) of the sensor monitoring stations used in this dataset (all files in the "esdr_raw" folder) can be found on the [ESDR data visualization page](https://environmentaldata.org/#time=1642345888.849,1642950688.849&cursor=1642730480.675&plotHeight=5.000&plotAreaHeight=40.000&showFilters=true&showSettings=true&showResults=true&center=40.445982705178,-79.96401491796037&zoom=12). ESDR means the [Environmental Sensor Data Repository](https://esdr.cmucreatelab.org/), a service for hosting environmental data. The feed ID and the channel name in the [code for gettting the sensor data](/py/prediction/getData.py) corresponds to the metadata on the visualization page.

**More description about the sensor data is in [another README file](/dataset/v2.1#description-of-the-air-quality-sensor-data).**
